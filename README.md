## Introduction

Welcome to JET-RADAR! This repository houses a data collection and visualisation system that utilizes the ADS-B Exchange API to gather live data from private aircraft. By creating a robust pipeline and leveraging the Dash framework, JET-RADAR allows you to store, analyze, and visualize real-time data related to aircraft, their owners and ultimately... their environmental impact.

### Our Purpose

At JET-RADAR, our purpose is to raise awareness about the carbon emissions generated by the rich and powerful through their extensive use of private jets. By providing detailed insights into the movements of celebrity jets, we aim to highlight the environmental impact of excessive air travel and encourage sustainable alternatives. Our platform serves as a valuable resource for media professionals, advocates of stricter legislation against private air travel, and environmental advocates, enabling them to access accurate data and make informed arguments for change. Together, we can promote responsible aviation practices, advocate for stricter legislature, and work towards a greener future.

### Features

- Real-time data collection from the ADS-B Exchange API.
- Storage of collected data in a database for historical analysis.
- Interactive visualisations powered by Dash to explore aircraft movements and emission statistics with a 24 hour delay.
- Customizable filters and search options to narrow down specific private aircraft owners.
- Integration with AWS services for a scalable and reliable architecture.

## Getting Started

To view our live Dashboard please click on the image below:

[![airplane door](https://twistedsifter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-06-at-8.33.44-AM.png?w=1024)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0)

Want to launch your own JET-RADAR data collection and visualisation system? Or do you want to contribute to the project? Follow the guidelines in the next sections to get started:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- <a href="https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html"><img src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/354447/terraform-icon.svg" height="20" alt="Terraform Logo"></a> Terraform (version 1.2.0 or above)

- <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Python-logo-notext.svg" height="20" alt="Python Logo"></a> Python (version 3.10 or above)

- Pip (a package installer for Python)

### Installation

To install and set up JET-RADAR, follow these steps:

1.  Fork the repository by clicking: <a href="https://github.com/aialshami/jet-radar/fork"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/GitHub_Fork_Button.png" height="15" alt="Python Logo"></a>

    This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2.  Add the necessary environment variables to your forked repository. These variables will include any API keys or configuration details required for the application to function properly.

3.  In your forked repository, navigate to the "Settings" tab and click on "Secrets" in the left sidebar. Click on the "New repository secret" button.

4.  Create a secret key-value pair for each of the following variables:

    - `ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS access key.
    - `SECRET_KEY`: Your AWS secret key.
    - `RAPIDAPI_KEY`: Your RapidAPI key.
    - `DB_PASSWORD`: Password for the database.

    **Note**: Ensure the secret keys are properly secured and not exposed publicly.

5.  Still in the "Settings" tab, click on "Environment" in the left sidebar. Click on the "New environment" button.

6.  Create an environment called `jet_env` and add the following variables:

    - `CELEB_INFO`: `celeb_planes.json`.
    - `DB_HOST`: Hostname or endpoint of your database server.
    - `DB_NAME`: Name of the database.
    - `DB_PORT`: Port number for database connection.
    - `DB_USER`: Username for the database.
    - `PRODUCTION_SCHEMA`: `production`.
    - `RAPIDAPI_HOST`: `adsbexchange-com1.p.rapidapi.com`.
    - `S3_BUCKET_NAME`: `jet-bucket`.
    - `STAGING_SCHEMA`: `staging`.
    - `STAGING_TABLE_NAME`: `tracked_event`.

7.  In your forked repository, run the deploy workflow by first, going into the action tab then activating workflows. This utilizes Terraform to create the AWS services required by the application. This action will provision the necessary infrastructure for data collection and storage.

8.  Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/JET-RADAR.git
    ```

9.  Change into the dashboard directory:

    ```bash
    cd JET-RADAR/dashboard
    ```

10. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

11. Start the application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    Access the JET-RADAR dashboard by opening a web browser and navigating to the provided link (e.g. **http://localhost:8080**). You should now see the dashboard and be able to interact with it locally.

    If you prefer, you can also deploy the JET-RADAR repository onto the EC2 instance built through terraform or any other hosting platform of your choice.

    1. Launch an EC2 instance on AWS and connect to it using SSH.

    2. Install Git on the EC2 instance. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install git
    ```

    3. Clone your forked repository onto the EC2 instance. Replace your-username and your-repo with your GitHub username and repository name respectively:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/jet-radar.git
    ```

    4. Change into the cloned repository directory:

    ```bash
    cd jet-radar
    ```

    5. Install the required dependencies. Make sure you have Python and Pip installed on the EC2 instance. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    6. Set up the necessary environment variables. You can either export the variables directly on the EC2 instance or create a .env file and populate it with the required variables.

    7. Start the application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    The JET-RADAR dashboard should now be accessible by opening a web browser and navigating to the provided IP address or domain name of your EC2 instance, along with the appropriate port (e.g., **http://your-ec2-ip-address:8080**).

    Remember to configure security groups and network settings for your EC2 instance to allow inbound traffic on the required port.

    Please note that these instructions assume a basic familiarity with AWS EC2 instances and SSH connections. Make sure to adjust the instructions as per your specific setup and requirements.

### The Dashboard

## ADS-B Exchange API

JET-RADAR utilizes the [**ADS-B Exchange API**](https://rapidapi.com/adsbx/api/adsbexchange-com1) to collect real-time data on private aircraft movements. This comprehensive API provides information on aircraft positions, flight numbers, and more. By integrating the ADS-B Exchange API, JET-RADAR ensures accurate and up-to-date data on private jet movements. With the ADS-B Exchange API, JET-RADAR offers a reliable platform for tracking and recording unsustainable aviation practices.
