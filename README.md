## Introduction 🌍✈️

Welcome to MUSK-JET! This repository houses a data collection and visualization system that utilizes the ADS-B Exchange API to gather live data from private aircraft. By creating a robust pipeline and leveraging the Dash framework, MUSK-JET allows you to store, analyze, and visualize real-time data related to aircraft, their owners and ultimately... their environmental impact.

### Our Purpose

At MUSK-JET, our purpose is to raise awareness about the carbon emissions generated by the rich and powerful through their extensive use of private jets. By providing detailed insights into the movements of celebrity jets, we aim to highlight the environmental impact of excessive air travel and encourage sustainable alternatives. Our platform serves as a valuable resource for media professionals, advocates of stricter legislation against private air travel, and environmental advocates, enabling them to access accurate data and make informed arguments for change. Together, we can promote responsible aviation practices, advocate for stricter legislature, and work towards a greener future. ♻️🌎

### Features

Real-time data collection from the ADS-B Exchange API.
Storage of collected data in a database for historical analysis.
Interactive visualizations powered by Dash to explore aircraft movements and emission statistics.
Customizable filters and search options to narrow down specific private aircraft owners.
Integration with AWS services for a scalable and reliable architecture.
