## Introduction

Welcome to JET-RADAR! This repository houses a data collection and visualisation system that utilizes the ADS-B Exchange API to gather live data from private aircraft. By creating a robust pipeline and leveraging the Dash framework, JET-RADAR allows you to store, analyze, and visualize real-time data related to aircraft, their owners and ultimately... their environmental impact.

### Our Purpose

At JET-RADAR, our purpose is to raise awareness about the carbon emissions generated by the rich and powerful through their extensive use of private jets. By providing detailed insights into the movements of celebrity jets, we aim to highlight the environmental impact of excessive air travel and encourage sustainable alternatives. Our platform serves as a valuable resource for media professionals, advocates of stricter legislation against private air travel, and environmental advocates, enabling them to access accurate data and make informed arguments for change. Together, we can promote responsible aviation practices, advocate for stricter legislature, and work towards a greener future.

### Features

- Real-time data collection from the ADS-B Exchange API.
- Storage of collected data in a database for historical analysis.
- Interactive visualisations powered by Dash to explore aircraft movements and emission statistics with a 24 hour delay.
- Customizable filters and search options to narrow down specific private aircraft owners.
- Integration with AWS services for a scalable and reliable architecture.

### The Dashboard

## ADS-B Exchange API

JET-RADAR utilizes the [**ADS-B Exchange API**](https://rapidapi.com/adsbx/api/adsbexchange-com1) to collect real-time data on private aircraft movements. This comprehensive API provides information on aircraft positions, flight numbers, and more. By integrating the ADS-B Exchange API, JET-RADAR ensures accurate and up-to-date data on private jet movements. With the ADS-B Exchange API, JET-RADAR offers a reliable platform for tracking and recording unsustainable aviation practices.

## The Architecture

### AWS Services

![data architecture](https://i.ibb.co/ZNSq37D/image-2.png)

1. ECR (Elastic Container Registry): JET-RADAR utilizes two ECR repositories. The staging ECR holds a dockerised image of the extract application. This application extracts data from the ADS-B Exchange API and stores it in a staging schema in an RDS (Relational Database Service). The production ECR contains a dockerised image of the transform application, which cleans the data and calculates metrics such as fuel usage.

2. Lambda: The extract application is deployed as a Lambda function and triggered by EventBridge every 10 minutes. This ensures regular extraction of data from the ADS-B Exchange API and storage in the staging schema. The transform application is also deployed as a Lambda function, triggered by EventBridge to run every 24 hours. This periodic execution allows for data cleaning and metric calculations and is in consideration of the aircraft user's safety.

3. RDS (Relational Database Service): JET-RADAR utilizes an RDS instance with two schemas. The staging schema stores the extracted data from the ADS-B Exchange API, serving as an intermediate storage for the raw data before the transformation process. The production schema holds the transformed and processed data, which is ready for consumption by the dashboard server.

4. S3 (Simple Storage Service): JET-RADAR utilizes an S3 bucket to store the documentation required for the extract application. This bucket holds the necessary resources for extracting and processing data from the ADS-B Exchange API.

5. EventBridge: EventBridge acts as a central event bus that triggers the extract and transform Lambda functions. It enables scheduling and orchestrating the periodic execution of these functions at specific intervals. With EventBridge, JET-RADAR ensures the timely and automated execution of data extraction and transformation processes.

6. EC2 Instance and Load Balancer: The dashboard server, responsible for visualizing the data, is hosted on an EC2 instance. A load balancer ensures scalability and high availability of the dashboard. The dashboard server pulls data from the production schema in the RDS, where the transformed and processed data is stored.

### Database Schema

JET-RADAR utilizes two distinct database schemas: the staging schema and the production schema. These schemas are designed to efficiently store and manage the extracted and transformed data from the ADS-B Exchange API.

**Staging Schema**:
The staging schema represents an unnormalised structure with a single table that holds the raw extracted data. This schema serves as an intermediate storage for the data before it undergoes the transformation process. Here is an image representing the structure of the staging schema:

![staging erd](https://i.ibb.co/wsC6KgH/draw-SQL-staging-export-2023-05-17.png)

**Production Schema**:
The production schema employs a normalised structure to store the transformed and processed data. It consists of 11 tables that are organized to the 3rd degree of normalisation, ensuring data integrity and reducing redundancy. The tables in the production schema are designed to efficiently store and query the data for visualization and analysis. Here is an image illustrating the structure of the production schema:

![production erd](https://i.ibb.co/hBFhq2c/draw-SQL-production-export-2023-05-25.png)

By utilizing these two schemas, JET-RADAR effectively manages the data flow from extraction to transformation and provides a well-organized structure for storing and retrieving the processed data.
